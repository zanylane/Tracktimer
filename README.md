Pinewood Derby Racetrack Timer

This is relatively simple code, meant to run the timers for a Pinewood Derby Racetrack. I have plenty more info up on my site.

This was written to run an Arduino Pro Mini. I've neve attempted to run it for anything else, but it shouldn't take too much to modify, I think.
